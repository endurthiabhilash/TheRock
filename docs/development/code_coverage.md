# Code Coverage

TheRock builds ROCm libraries with LLVM's source based code coverage
instrumentation and reports the results to
[Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ROCm/TheRock). Coverage is opt-in per
project: instrumentation slows a library down substantially, and the report is
only worth producing for projects whose test suites are thorough enough to give
a meaningful signal.

## Enabling coverage for a local build

Pass `-D<PROJECT>_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON` at the top level configure. The project
name must be upper case, matching the usual CMake convention for definitions:

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja . \
  -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx94X-dcgpu \
  -DHIPRAND_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON \
  -DCOMPILER_RT_BUILD_PROFILE_ROCM=ON
```

`therock_subproject.cmake` forwards the flag to the matching subproject, which
is responsible for translating it into compiler flags (usually
`-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping`). Passing the flag for a project
that does not implement it has no effect.

`COMPILER_RT_BUILD_PROFILE_ROCM=ON` builds `libclang_rt.profile_rocm`, the
device side profiling runtime. Without it, instrumented device code cannot write
profiles, and you will only see host coverage.

> [!NOTE]
> Coverage builds are incompatible with split kernel packaging. The CI
> workflows pass `-DTHEROCK_FLAG_KPACK_SPLIT_ARTIFACTS=OFF`; do the same if you
> build with a target family that enables kernel packing by default.

### Enabling a whole group

Three aggregate options turn on coverage for a whole component group instead of
naming each project. All default `OFF`:

| Option                                | Instruments                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THEROCK_COVERAGE_ROCM_LIBRARIES_ALL` | all coverage-enabled rocm-libraries projects (math-libs, ml-libs …) |
| `THEROCK_COVERAGE_ROCM_SYSTEMS_ALL`   | all coverage-enabled rocm-systems projects                          |
| `THEROCK_COVERAGE_ALL`                | both of the above                                                   |

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja . \
  -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx94X-dcgpu \
  -DTHEROCK_COVERAGE_ROCM_LIBRARIES_ALL=ON \
  -DCOMPILER_RT_BUILD_PROFILE_ROCM=ON
```

Each option expands to the individual `<PROJECT>_ENABLE_COVERAGE` flags above, so
the same device-runtime and kernel-packing caveats apply. An explicit
`-D<PROJECT>_ENABLE_COVERAGE=OFF` on the command line wins over the group flag.
Group membership is generated from the coverage registry (`COVERAGE_PROJECTS`),
so a group only ever contains onboarded projects; selecting a group with none
(currently rocm-systems) configures nothing and prints a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> These options default `OFF` and have no effect on a normal, non-coverage build
> — no `<PROJECT>_ENABLE_COVERAGE` flag is set. The membership list is
> regenerated from `COVERAGE_PROJECTS` on every configure (a small scripted step;
> it also means editing `configure_coverage_ci.py` triggers a reconfigure), but
> it only changes the build when one of the options is `ON`.

## Producing a report locally

Instrumented binaries write one `.profraw` file per process, named by the
`LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` environment variable. The `%p` (pid) and `%m` (binary
signature) substitutions keep concurrent processes from clobbering each other:

```bash
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="$PWD/coverage-report/profraw/%p-%m.profraw"
ctest --test-dir build/math-libs/hiprand
```

`merge_coverage_report.py` then merges the profiles and exports lcov:

```bash
python build_tools/github_actions/merge_coverage_report.py \
  --profraw-dir coverage-report/profraw \
  --rocm-dir build/dist/rocm \
  --object-globs "lib/libhiprand.so*"
```

The `llvm-profdata` and `llvm-cov` binaries must come from the same compiler
that built the instrumented objects, so the script prefers the copies under
`<rocm-dir>/lib/llvm/bin`. A version mismatch surfaces as an unhelpfully generic
"malformed instrumentation profile data" error.

## Coverage CI

Two workflows produce the reports that land in Codecov. Both take their project
list from `build_tools/github_actions/configure_coverage_ci.py`, which is the
registry of coverage-enabled projects and everything the pipeline needs to know
about each one: the CMake target, the build stage it lives in, its test
component, the object globs handed to `llvm-cov`, and its Codecov flag.

| Workflow                             | Trigger                                         | Build strategy                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `multi_arch_ci_coverage.yml`         | `ci:coverage` label on a PR, or manual dispatch | Builds the instrumented compiler-runtime once, then rebuilds only the target project for each matrix entry |
| `multi_arch_ci_coverage_nightly.yml` | Nightly schedule, or manual dispatch            | Builds the whole instrumented stack once, then tests and reports on each project against that single build |

Both delegate to `multi_arch_ci_coverage_linux.yml`, which owns the per-project
build, test, and aggregation sequence for one GPU family. Keeping the nesting at
three levels matters: GitHub refuses to run reusable workflows nested more than
four deep.

The test jobs run through the same `test_component.yml` as regular CI, with
`coverage_enabled: true` adding an `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` pointing into the
workspace and uploading the resulting profiles as an artifact. The aggregation
job downloads the profiles from every shard, merges them, and uploads the lcov
report.

### Selecting projects to run

Both workflows' `projects_to_test` input takes a comma-separated list of project
names, and also accepts three case-insensitive **group aliases** that expand to a
whole component group: `rocm_libraries_all`, `rocm_systems_all`, and `all`. They
may be mixed with explicit names, an empty input still means "every project", and
selecting a group with no onboarded projects fails the run with a clear error
rather than launching an empty matrix.

The aliases are expanded to concrete project names inside
`configure_coverage_ci.py` before the job matrix is built, so nothing downstream
ever sees them: the coverage pipeline hands `fetch_test_configurations.py`
(shared with regular CI) an already-resolved per-project `test_component`, never
an alias. The `projects_to_test` input and these aliases exist only on the two
coverage workflows, so non-coverage test selection is unaffected.

### Adding a project

Add an entry to `COVERAGE_PROJECTS` in `configure_coverage_ci.py`. Before doing
so, confirm that the project implements `<PROJECT>_ENABLE_COVERAGE` in its own
CMake, and that a local instrumented build produces a non-empty report. A
project whose tests never load the instrumented library will build and test
cleanly but report zero coverage.

Set the entry's `source_repo` (`ROCM_LIBRARIES` by default, or `ROCM_SYSTEMS`);
that is what routes the project into the correct group alias and
`THEROCK_COVERAGE_*_ALL` option. No CMake edit is needed — the group membership
lists are generated from `COVERAGE_PROJECTS` at configure time, so both the local
aggregate flags and the CI aliases pick up the new project automatically.
